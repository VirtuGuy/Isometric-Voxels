# Isometric Voxels
 Isometric Voxels is an isometric voxel engine made in the game engine [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/). Isometric Voxels originally started as a project on Scratch and was supposed to be a pizzeria tycoon game. The isometric look of the original game was so fun to mess with that an isometric voxel engine was accidentally created. With the engine being fun to create, the project got reworked in [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) the same day of the original project's creation.
